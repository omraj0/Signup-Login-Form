## Design Choices

- **React.js**: Chosen for its flexibility and community support.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and catches errors early.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implemented to provide secure access to the application.
- **Form Handling**: Custom form handling logic instead of Formik, showcasing the ability to build forms from scratch.

## Assumptions and Limitations

- **Assumptions**: The application is designed for educational purposes and may not be production-ready.
- **Limitations**: Third-party UI libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design were avoided as per the constraints.

## How to Use

1. **Sign Up**: Fill in the sign-up form with your details and submit.
2. **Login**: Use your credentials to log in.
3. **Remember Me**: Optional feature not implemented in this version.
4. **Password Strength Indicator**: Optional feature not implemented in this version.

## Future Improvements

- Add a "Remember Me" checkbox to save the email in local storage.
- Implement a password strength indicator in the Sign Up form.
- Enhance accessibility with proper ARIA roles and labels.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to build a functional React application with authentication and authorization, adhering to clean coding principles and good UX practices.
